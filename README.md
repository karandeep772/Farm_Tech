# Farm_Tech
Farmtech is a term that refers to the use of technology in agriculture, such as in farming, digital tools and automation. Farmtech is becoming increasingly popular in todayís world as farmers seek to improve their efficiency?and productivity by using innovative technologies. By utilising Farmtech website solutions, farmers can reduce cost,  optimise resource management, and can enhance crop yields.
 
The problem being addressed in our topic is the financial burden that  small farmers face when trying to purchase new machineries. As we know agriculture is  an industry that relies heavily on machinery to improve efficiency and productivity but new machines can be very expensive and not all farmers can afford to purchase them outright. This can limit their ability to stay competitive in the market. Also some farmers face challenges in keeping their farm machines with them for the entire year due to high maintenance cost, seasonal use and mainly the technology advancements. This can lead to reduced productivity, increased storage requirements and a lack of access to newer and more efficient equipment.
 
So to overcome this problem we bring a solution by giving farmers an opportunity to borrow machines , equipment,  implements through our website ëFarmtechí from other farmers who own these machines. This can be a cost effective solution that allows the  farmers to access the machinery they need without incurring the full upfront cost or significant debts.
 
There are many benefits for farmers who choose to rent out their machinery to other farmers as  this can be their additional source of income ,reducing their costs of maintaining ,repair in that period of time. By doing this their machinery is used more frequently and efficiently rather than sitting idle for long periods. They can upgrade to new machinery more frequently which can increase their productivity in future.
 
There are also many benefits for small farmers who borrow machinery  as now they do not have to take big debts to buy new machinery, this way they can save their costs a lot. For short term projects or seasonal needs this method of borrowing can provide them flexibility in terms of duration in which the equipment will be used. By borrowing machines they can also save  a lot of storage costs and space. This method also  help to improve their cash flows by allowing them to allocate resources to other areas of their operation  such as labour.
 
Technologies used in this project are;
Front-end web  development: This website is built  by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript to create a user friendly interface.
